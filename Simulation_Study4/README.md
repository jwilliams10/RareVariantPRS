## Simulation_Study4

This folder contains code to perform RICE for simulated data with 49,173 individuals of EUR ancestry in the training dataset assuming a proportion of rare variants are causal within a causal rare variant set. The scripts are almost a carbon copy of the scripts in WES/Continuous/ but slimmed down for speed. The scripts perform RICE for the smallest training fraction and are executed using the all.sh script.
