## AoU

Analyses for All of Us were conducted on the All of Us research workbench which requires batch jobs to be submitted from a Python interactive Jupyter notebook using dsub. Therefore almost all of the analyses are stored in the Submission_Script.ipynb script. The script follows a similar outline to the UKB WES analysis with the caveat that the common variant PRSs were CT-SLEB, JointPRS, and PROSPER instead of CT, LDpred2, and Lassosum2. The other remaining scripts are to set up JointPRS/PROSPER and to run JointPRS on a local HPC as it can be done without the use of the tuning or validation data. AoU_CrossPlatform files are to test the cross-platform performance of RICE trained on AoU onto UKB. AoU_CrossPlatform_Results.R creates Figure 8 and Supplementary Figure 28. Figure 7, Supplementary Figure 23, and Supplementary Figure 24 was created with Overall_Results.R and lastly, Supplementary Figures 25 and 26 were created using the Figures.ipynb script.
