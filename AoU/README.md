Analyses for All of Us were conducted on the All of Us research workbench which requires batch jobs to be submitted from a Python interactive Jupyter notebook using dsub. Therefore almost all of the analyses are stored in the Submission_Script.ipynb script. The script follows a similar outline to the UKB WES analysis with the caveat that the common variant PRSs were CT-SLEB, JointPRS, and PROSPER instead of CT, LDpred2, and Lassosum2. The other remaining scripts are to set up JointPRS/PROSPER and to run JointPRS on a local HPC as it can be done without the use of the tuning or validation data. Lastly, Supplementary Figures 18 and 19 were created using the Figures.ipynb script.
